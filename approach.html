    <h3>About Amanda</h3>
    <p>Amanda Deaver is Founder and President of Upstream Strategic Communications.  With nearly 20 years of PR agency experience, she has developed and managed effective advocacy and public affairs campaigns as well as crisis and litigation communications programs for clients in nearly every sector.</p>
    <p>Amanda’s diverse client roster has included major companies in the financial, health care, energy and defense industries as well as non-profit advocacy organizations, issue coalitions and trade associations addressing a broad range of issues, from the environment and education to addiction and mental health services.</p>
    <p>Prior to launching Upstream in 2015, Amanda co-founded Prism Public Affairs in 2003, which merged with Rasky Baerlein in 2014.  Before that, Amanda was a vice president at Powell Tate, a Washington, D.C. public affairs firm.</p>
    <p>Earlier in her career, Amanda handled media affairs and program development for several youth-serving organizations and had a brief stint as a substitute high school English teacher at her alma mater, Holton-Arms.  She received her bachelor’s degree from Brown University.</p>
    <p>Amanda’s passions extend beyond the client realm. She has served on the board of numerous non-profit organizations including American Rivers, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, Advocates for Youth and the Kakenya Center for Excellence.</p>
    <p>And perhaps most relevant to the Upstream ethos, Amanda is an avid angler when she can get out of the office.  Her favorite place to be – deep in an Idaho river with a fly rod in her hand and a smile on her face.</p>
