    <h2>Experience Matters</h2>

    <p class="large">Thatâ€™s especially true when the stakes are high. With more than 20 years of experience running successful communications campaigns, the team at Upstream Strategic Communications knows how to deliver results that make a difference.</p>
    <p>We have represented a diverse range of clients, ranging from companies, law firms and trade associations to coalitions and non-profit organizations. The focus of those engagements has been just  as varied as our clients.</p>
    <h4>Financial Services</h4>
    <p>We have worked with mortgage lenders, investment companies and insurers on public policy matters as well as congressional investigations and government litigation.</p>
    <h4>Healthcare</h4>
    <p>Experience in the healthcare sector has included multiple clients in the mental health and addiction treatment field, several disease groups,  as well as companies in the life sciences and diagnostics industries.</p>
    <h4>Education</h4>
    <p>Non-profit education-oriented organizations and trade associations have turned to us to develop, manage and implement advocacy and positioning campaigns. These campaigns addressed higher education accrediting agency issues as well as those of elementary and secondary education.</p>
    <h4>Energy and Sustainability</h4>
    <p>We have represented utilities working through regulatory changes as well as several advocacy organizations addressing sustainability and conservation policies.</p>
