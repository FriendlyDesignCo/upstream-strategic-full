    <h2>Our Services</h2>
    <p class="large">We are battle-tested, passionate about what we do and ready to put that experience and energy to work, delivering results that make a difference for our clients.</p>

    <a name="mission" id="mission"></a>
    <h3>Mission-Driven Advocacy</h3> 

    <h4>Issue Positioning</h4>

    <p>Defining the terms of the debate from the outset is the first step.  Then the real work begins – communicating through diverse channels as part of a sustained, targeted campaign to reach policy makers and other core audiences.  </p>

    <h4>Public Policy Campaigns</h4>

    <p>When organizational goals and government policy intersect, we work with the government relations team to develop and implement complementary strategic communications programs that make a difference.</p>
    <h4>Coalition Building and Management</h4>
    <p>Sometimes there is strength in numbers.  We bring diverse allies together to elevate and advance support of a single, shared goal. </p>
    <h4>Digital Advocacy Campaigns</h4>
    <p>The public square has shifted.  No campaign can be effective today without a smart digital program, from monitoring and analysis to ally recruitment and advocacy.  Getting the mix right from the beginning – that’s what we do.</p>

    <h3>High-Stakes Reputation Management </h3>

    <h4>Crisis and Litigation Communications</h4>
    <p>We have  successfully dealt with many high-stakes communications challenges. In close consultation with the legal team, we design programs that strike the right balance between short-term instincts and long-term goals.</p>

    <h4>Government Investigations</h4>
    <p>When companies and individuals find themselves in the spotlight, managing reputations and limiting damage is only the beginning. We design campaigns to ensure a strong future long after the spotlight ends.</p>

    <h4>Executive Transitions</h4>
    <p>Communicating change effectively can be a significant challenge. But if managed right, it is also an opportunity to strengthen reputations. We work to identify all communications needs and set our clients up to make the most of transitions, both internally and externally.</p>

    <h3>Core Communications Services </h3> 
    <h4>Message Development and Editorial Services</h4>
    <p>Getting the message right is the first step. But we don’t stop there. We know how to write and present content to maximize the impact with the audience.</p>

    <h4>Media Relations</h4>
    <p>It takes a lot to break through today’s cluttered media environment. We know how to craft media relations campaigns that get results.</p>

    <h4>Media and Presentation Training</h4>
    <p>The best messages only work if they are delivered effectively.  We help clients prepare to be successful, no matter the venue. </p>

    <h4>Strategic Planning to Maximize In-House Operations</h4>
    <p>Sometimes it helps to get a second opinion, an outside perspective, a fresh look. And then we follow up with concrete recommendations and support to implement them.
